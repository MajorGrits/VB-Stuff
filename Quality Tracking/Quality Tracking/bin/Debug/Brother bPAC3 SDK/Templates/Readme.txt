             ***** About this folder *****

The sample projects for the b-PAC component assume that this folder is located at C:\Program Files\Brother bPAC3 SDK\Templates.

If this folder is installed at a location other than that mentioned above, create the folder C:\Program Files\Brother bPAC3 SDK\Templates (if it does not already exist), and then copy all files contained in this folder to the newly created Templates folder so that the sample projects can be used.

In addition, this limitation only applies to the sample projects, not to the b-PAC component.
